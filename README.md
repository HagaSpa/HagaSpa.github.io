## Features

### 📝 Convert MD to PDF

You can generate PDF with [md-to-pdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/md-to-pdf).


```
$ yarn build:pdf
```

The output PDF can be styled as you like with CSS. Edit the `pdf-configs/style.css`.  

### 🛠 Create release

When you push with a `v**` tag, GitHub Actions will run the build, generate the PDF, create a Release, and register the PDF to Assets.

```
$ git commit -m "add job"
$ git tag v1.0
$ git push origin --tags
```
